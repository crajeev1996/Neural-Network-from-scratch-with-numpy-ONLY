# Neural-Network-from-scratch-with-numpy-ONLY
In this project, I develop an entire framework of functions to implement an L-layer deep neural network in Python where you can specify the number and size of hidden layers, learning rates and number of training epochs. 

Two datasets are used to evaluate the framework, the famous MNIST dataset and the cat-vs-noncat dataset. After several minutes of training, I have obtained parameters which can predict with a test accuracy of above 95% for the MNUST data nd about 76% for the cat-vs-noncat data.
